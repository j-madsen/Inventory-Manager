# Inventory Manager

This is a GUI-based application created using Java and Java FX. It is an inventory management system that allows the user to add, modify, or delete products and parts. Search functionality and form/selection validation are included. The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern was utilized to develop the application.

# Demo

This is the main screen where you can view all parts and products. You have the option of adding, modifying, or deleting either. You can also exit the application.

The add product screen is a little different. You have the option of selecting a part from inventory and associating it with the product you're creating.
